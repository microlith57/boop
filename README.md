# Boop

## WARNING: Not production-ready!

Boop is a web application which acts like a library checkout system, but for computers, allowing for an efficient barcode-based issue/return workflow.

Its current main goal is to be better than writing on paper.

For the WIP code, see the `develop` branch.

<!-- This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running. -->

<!-- Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration

* Database creation

* Database initialization

* How to run the test suite

* Services (job queues, cache servers, search engines, etc.)

* Deployment instructions

* ... -->
